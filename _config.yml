resume_header_intro: "<p>Hello, I’m Katia. With roots spread across three continents, I’ve embraced a global perspective that fuels my passion for storytelling and environmental protection. Growing up near the protected beaches of Costa Rica, I gained an early appreciation for nature, which led me to champion causes for marine life and sustainability. My travels and multicultural experiences shape my creativity, from documentary filmmaking to creating collage art that reflects my diverse background. Whether through teaching life skills, promoting recycled fashion, or volunteering for animal welfare, I seek to make a difference by connecting people to the world around them.
